        <h3>Insanly Great</h3>
    <p>Insanely great Steve Jobs During that same period, Jobs was heading<br> the most important project in the company’s history. In 1979 he led a small group of<br> Apple engineers to a technology demonstration at the Xerox Corporation’s Palo<br> Alto Research Center (PARC) to see how the graphical user interface could make<br> computers easier to use and more efficient.</p>
    <h3>Founding of Apple</h3>
    <p>Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now<br> known as Silicon Valley. Though he was interested in engineering, his passions of<br> youth varied. He dropped out of Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, took a job at<br> Atari Corporation as a video game designer in early 1974, and saved enough money<br> for a pilgrimage to India to experience Buddhism.</p>
    <h3>NeXT and Pixar</h3>
    <p>Jobs quickly started another firm, NeXT Inc., designing powerful workstation<br> computers for the education market. His funding partners included Texan entrepreneur<br> Ross Perot and Canon Inc., a Japanese electronics company. Although the NeXT<br> computer was notable for its engineering design, it was eclipsed by less costly<br> computers from competitors such as Sun Microsystems, Inc.</p>
    <h3>Saving Apple</h3>
    <p>In late 1996 Apple, saddled by huge financial losses and on the verge of collapse,<br> hired a new chief executive, semiconductor executive Gilbert Amelio. When Amelio<br> learned that the company, following intense and prolonged research efforts, had<br> failed to develop an acceptable replacement for the Macintosh’s aging operating<br> system (OS), he chose NEXTSTEP, buying Jobs’s company for more than $400<br> million—and bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant</p>
    <h3>Reinventing Apple</h3>
    <p>In 2001 Jobs started reinventing Apple for the 21st century. That was the year that<br> Apple introduced iTunes, a computer program for playing music and for converting<br> music to the compact MP3 digital format commonly used in computers and other<br> digital devices.</p>
    <h3>Health Issues</h3>
    <p>In 2003 Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. He put off surgery<br> for about nine months while he tried alternative medicine approaches. In 2004 he<br> underwent a major reconstructive surgery known as the Whipple operation. During<br> the procedure, part of the pancreas, a portion of the bile duct, the gallbladder,<br> and the duodenum were removed, after which what was left of the pancreas,<br> the bile duct, and the intestine were reconnected to direct the gastrointestinal<br> secretions back into the stomach.</p>
